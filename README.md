<h1>Java Movie Management</h1>
This project hosts the code for a CLI program (developed in Java using JetBrains IntellJ) that I worked on during my time at University of Chester. By using serialization, users can add, edit and remove items as well as sorting by price, year and name. The total and average prices of all listed items can be calculated.
All of these functions can be found in the main menu. Each item in the database has a fixed set of properties defined in a class called DiskProperty. Comparators were created to provide the sorting capabilities.
